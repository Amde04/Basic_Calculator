This project is a basic calculator built with Python and Tkinter, providing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for performing arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and negative numbers using a secure expression evaluation with the ast module. The interface includes text areas for displaying operations and results, along with buttons for digits, decimal points, operators, clearing inputs, and calculating the final result. The layout is clean, fixed in size, and styled with a dark background, making it an easy-to-use and beginner-friendly calculator application.
